 Definition:
 	5 philosophers they have id from 0 to 4;
 	each of them has a chopstick on left and right, 5 chopsticks totally
 	Let the id of left chopstick = the id of philosopher, then the 
 	id of right chopstick = (id_philosopher + 4) % 5.
 
 Main idea:
 	Introducing a waiter to arrange philosophers' dining requests.	
 	At most 4 philosophers can hold 1 each at the same time to 
 	prevent dead lock. Queue to prevent starvation.
 	
 Reference:
 	Read "Dining philosophers problem" on Wikipedia
 	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem
 	//It defines the problem to me and inspires me to came up with
 	some initial ideas
 
    Watched a YouTube video "Learn OS Concepts easy: Dining 
    philosophers problem" 
    link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trdXKhWAGdg
    //This video clearly states the problem, and inspires me the 
    possible critical moment could occur during process
    
	   "Queue data structure implementation in C" 
    link: https://blog.csdn.net/qq_28877125/article/details/82776561
    //I used this struct to store philosophers' dining priority,
    which is first come first eat.
    
    
 Milestones: philosophers all get chance to eat	
 			 No dead locks! (No 5 person each gets 1 chopstick)
 			 No starvation! (priority mechanism let every one get eat)
 			 
 
 Possible Bug: N/A
