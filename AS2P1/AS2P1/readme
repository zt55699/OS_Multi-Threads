 Reference:
	   "CSC360 Coursespace Forum":
	   		I got lots of inspirations there.
	  
 Milestones: Test1 PASS;	
 			 Test2 PASS;	
 			 Test3 PASS;
 			 Test4 PASS;
 			 BattleWorm runs SUCCESSFULLY;
 			 All goals achieved!
 			 
 Functions added:			 
 		int round_robin_next()
 			/*In Round-robin fashion choose next task to run
 			  Choose next task in the arry, if its state is "run" 
 			  and not waiting for others then run it. Otherwise 
 			  iterate to next task, do the same check to decide run
 			  it or not. Also check wakeup condition and get_char 
 			  condition in the loop. Return the id of task to run.*/
 			  
 		void waiting_check()
 			/*Once a task exit, update or not main task's state, 
 			  then call waiting_check() to check main task's state,
 			  if its waiting array is cleared, then set main's state
 			  to running. */
 		
 		void print_wait_arr()
 			/*Only used for debugging, which prints out the waiting
 			  condition. */
 			 
 Alternative solution: Use signal interrupt to check wakeup or getch
 
 Possible Bug: N/A
